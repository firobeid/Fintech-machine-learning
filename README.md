# Financial Applications of Machine Learning
My machine learning industry projects throughout the course in my Financial Engineering Program

- Built Gradient Boosting, Neural Network and Logistic Regression models after processing data and feature selection.
- Interpreted models to eliminate black box bias
- Ran grid search to fine tune the model's parameters and analyzed models stability (variance and bias).
- Sorted customers based on the probability of default estimated by each model, and segmented customers in to 10 bad rate buckets.
- Priced each buckets relevant interest rate and expected Net Present Value per segment.
